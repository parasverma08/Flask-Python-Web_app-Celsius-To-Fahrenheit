# Flask-Python-Web_app-Celsius-To-Fahrenheit
The celsius_to_fahr.sh script creates a virtual environment and installs all the python dependencies listed in requirements.txt file there to run the webapp.
It then runs the main.py file which starts the webapp at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.
You can then enter the temperature in celsius to convert it to its equivalent fahrenheit.
The app.yaml file is also provided in case user wants to host this webapp at Google App Engine.
